Attendance Through Event Achievement

A DBMS mini-project web application that allows students to earn academic attendance by participating in approved events and submitting achievement certificates, which are verified by faculty/admin.

This system digitizes attendance validation and encourages student participation in technical and academic activities.

Traditional attendance systems do not account for extracurricular achievements.
